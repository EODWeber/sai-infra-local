Local Docker Compose stack for the Secure AI Platform. This repo hosts the baseline services (e.g., MLflow, Loki/Grafana, Vault, OTel Collector) used by other `sai-*` components.

## Quickstart

> Requires Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) with Compose v2.

```bash
# clone & enter
git clone https://github.com/EODWeber/sai-infra-local.git
cd sai-infra-local

# start
make up

# follow logs
make logs

# stop & remove volumes
make down
```

## Enabling Services

Uncomment services in `docker-compose.yml` incrementally. Recommended order:

1. `loki` and `grafana` (observability)
2. `otel-collector` (telemetry ingestion)
3. `mlflow` (model registry/tracking)
4. `vault` (secrets)
5. `caddy` (reverse proxy)

## Notes

- Keep secrets out of the repo; use Vault or local env vars.
- Pair this with `sai-observability-stack` for dashboards and OTel configs.
- See the program index in `sai-platform-meta` for the big-picture architecture.
